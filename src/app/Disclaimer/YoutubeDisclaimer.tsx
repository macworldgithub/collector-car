          Collector Car Depot is not responsible for any of the content on
          YouTube, regardless of whether or not it is accessed via the embedded
          video clips on this site. The YouTube content is not hosted on our
          server and falls under YouTube’s own Terms of Use policy.
        </p>

        <p>
          Note that after a video clip plays, YouTube may automatically show
          thumbnails of related videos which can be played in the embedded video
          player. Again, Collector Car Depot based in Valentine NSW are not
          responsible for this content. In virtually all cases, the related
          videos will be directly on the subject of the video, although that can
          range from that subject to videos of other subjects including:
          editorials, humour, or songs and etc…
        </p>

        <p>
          YouTube provides these related video links automatically based on the
          subjects and keywords that users assign to their videos, so it is
          possible that an unrelated video link could infiltrate, unbeknown to
          both Collector Car Depot and YouTube, and that a viewer may feel that
          such content is in some way inappropriate. Anyone who has any concerns
          about this possibility is encouraged to avoid viewing YouTube videos
          on this website.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you have any additional questions concerning YouTube’s content you
          should seek contact with YouTube directly, although we would be
          interested to hear of any concerns you may have.
